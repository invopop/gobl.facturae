## Usage

### Go

There are a couple of entry points to build a new FacturaE document. If you already have a GOBL Envelope available in Go, you could convert and output to a data file like this:

```golang
doc, err := facturae.NewInvoice(env)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

data, err := doc.Bytes()
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

if err = os.WriteFile("./test.xml", data, 0644); err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
```

If you're loading from a file, you can use the `LoadGOBL` convenience method:

```golang
doc, err := facturae.LoadGOBL(file)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
// do something with doc
```

Outputting to a FacturaE XML is most useful when the document is signed. Use a certificate to sign the document as follows:

```golang
// import from github.com/invopop/xmldsig
cert, err := xmldsig.LoadCertificate(filename, password)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

doc, err := facturae.NewInvoice(env, facturae.WithCertificate(cert))
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
```

### CLI

The command line interface is useful when working with languages other than Go.

#### Installation

```bash
go install github.com/invopop/gobl.facturae/cmd/gobl.facturae@latest
```

#### Usage

Convert a GOBL JSON invoice to FacturaE XML:

```bash
gobl.facturae convert input.json output.xml
```

With a digital certificate:

```bash
gobl.facturae convert -c cert.p12 -p password input.json output.xml
```

The command also supports pipes:

```bash
cat input.json | gobl.facturae convert > output.xml
```

## Development

### Architecture Overview

The conversion process follows these steps:

1. **Load GOBL Envelope**: Parse the input JSON containing a GOBL invoice
2. **Remove Included Taxes**: If the invoice has `prices_include` set (e.g., VAT included in prices), the converter calls `invoice.RemoveIncludedTaxes()` to recalculate amounts from base prices. This is required because FacturaE expects taxes to be separate from base amounts.
3. **Invert Credit Notes**: If the document is a credit note, amounts are inverted to match FacturaE expectations
4. **Map to FacturaE Structure**: Convert GOBL structures to FacturaE XML elements
5. **Sign (Optional)**: Apply digital signature if a certificate is provided

**Important**: The `RemoveIncludedTaxes()` operation recalculates all amounts from item-level prices, which can introduce minor rounding differences (typically ±0.01) compared to the original GOBL totals. Test fixtures account for these expected differences.

### Testing

#### Dependencies

This package uses [lestrrat-go/libxml2](https://github.com/lestrrat-go/libxml2) for testing purposes, which depends on the libxml-2.0 C library. Install the development dependencies:

**Debian/Ubuntu:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev
```

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install libxml2
```

Additionally, for XML schema validation, you need xmllint:

**Debian/Ubuntu:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install libxml2-utils
```

**macOS:**
```bash
# xmllint is included with libxml2
brew install libxml2
```

#### Running Tests

Run all tests:
```bash
go test ./...
```

Run tests for a specific example:
```bash
go test -v -run "TestXMLGeneration/should_convert_invoice-vat.json"
```

#### Test Fixtures

Test data is organized in the `test/data/` directory:

- `*.json` - GOBL invoice envelopes (input)
- `out/*.xml` - Expected FacturaE XML output (fixtures)
- `schema/facturaev3_2_2.xsd` - Official FacturaE XML schema

#### Updating Fixtures

When you make changes that affect XML output, update the fixtures:

```bash
go test -run TestXMLGeneration --update
```

This will:
1. Convert all JSON examples to FacturaE XML
2. Validate each XML against the schema using xmllint (if installed)
3. Update the fixtures in `test/data/out/`

**Note**: If xmllint is not installed, the test will fail with a clear error message explaining how to install it. The validation step ensures generated XML is valid according to the official FacturaE schema.

#### Manual Testing with Certificates

For automated testing, XML documents are not signed. To generate signed documents for manual testing:

```bash
mage -v convertXML
```

Digital certificates for testing are available in `/test/certificates`.

#### Working with YAML Examples

Base examples can be written in YAML for easier editing. Convert YAML to GOBL JSON:

```bash
mage -v convertYAML
```

### Validation

To validate generated XML documents and digital signatures, use the official Spanish government validator:
- https://face.gob.es/es/facturas/validar-visualizar-facturas

### Code Structure

- **Go structures** use the same naming conventions as the FacturaE XML schema where possible. This means XML tag names are often omitted in struct definitions, making it easier to map between Go code and XML output.
- **Amount handling** uses `num.Amount` from GOBL for precise decimal arithmetic, with the `MinimalString()` method used for XML output to avoid trailing zeros.

### Common Issues and Troubleshooting

#### Rounding Differences in Tests

When working with invoices that have `prices_include` tax settings, you may notice small rounding differences (typically ±0.01) between:
- The original GOBL `payable` amount
- The FacturaE `TotalOutstandingAmount`/`TotalExecutableAmount`

This is **expected behavior** because:
1. GOBL invoices with included taxes store the gross (tax-included) amounts
2. FacturaE requires net (tax-excluded) amounts
3. The conversion calls `RemoveIncludedTaxes()` which recalculates everything from item-level unit prices
4. This multi-step recalculation can accumulate minor rounding differences

**Solution**: Test fixtures should reflect the amounts **after** conversion, not the original GOBL amounts. Update fixtures using `go test --update`.

#### xmllint Not Found

If you see an error like "xmllint not found in PATH" when running tests with `--update`:

1. The validation step requires xmllint to check generated XML against the schema
2. Install libxml2-utils (Debian/Ubuntu) or libxml2 (macOS)
3. This is only required when updating fixtures, not for regular test runs

#### Test Failures After GOBL Updates

When upgrading the GOBL dependency:
1. Amount calculation logic may change
2. Run `go test --update` to regenerate all fixtures
3. Manually verify a few key examples to ensure conversion is still correct
4. Check the official FacturaE validator for complex cases

## Current Conversion Limitations

The FacturaE format is quite complex due to the number of local requirements in Spain.

- _Payment Information_: FacturaE requires each payment instruction to have a Due Date. The GOBL invoice allows these details to be independent. If you require payment instructions to appear on a FacturaE document, there must be a due date.
